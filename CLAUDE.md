# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Flappy Bird game project designed for an 11-year-old child. The goal is to create a very simple, single-file HTML game that can run in a browser and be deployed to a web server.

## Requirements

Based on the project instructions:
1. Single file game (index.html)
2. Browser-based (HTML + JavaScript)
3. Very simple implementation
4. Mobile vertical layout view only (support small and larger screens)
5. Ready to deploy to remote web server
6. No build process or dependencies required

## Development Commands

This project requires no build, test, or compilation commands. It's a simple HTML file that can be:
- Opened directly in a browser for testing
- Deployed by copying the index.html file to any web server

## Architecture

- **Single file structure**: Everything contained in one index.html file
- **No external dependencies**: Uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Mobile-first design**: Optimized for vertical mobile screens
- **Simple game mechanics**: Basic Flappy Bird clone with minimal features

## Development Notes

- Keep the code simple and readable for educational purposes
- Focus on mobile vertical layout optimization
- Avoid complex libraries or frameworks
- Ensure the game works across different mobile screen sizes
- The target audience is a beginner, so code should be educational and well-commented
